# 🏆 Gamification With GitHub projects – A Team Gamification PoC

This is a **proof of concept** that transforms your GitHub workflow into a shared, visual XP tracker. Designed for teams working together in the same physical space, this project introduces light gamification to modern knowledge work — turning daily effort into a collective journey.

## ✨ What It Is

A static web dashboard (hosted via GitHub Pages) that:

- Tracks completed issues and assigns XP based on custom templates
- Automatically levels up the team with celebratory sounds and confetti
- Displays a live leaderboard with GitHub avatars
- Collects and displays visual achievements (badges) in a scrollable gallery

Ideal for running on a screen in a team room — encouraging celebration, progress, and a bit of fun competition.

## 💡 Why?

> _"Work doesn't need to be soulless to be professional."_

This project aims to gently restore a sense of momentum and shared purpose in teams. It adds visibility to the invisible: the effort behind closed issues, completed tasks, and quiet contributions.  
Gamification isn't about trivializing work — it's about **recognizing progress** and inviting joy.
